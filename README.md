**Can I contribute to this project?**
Of course, you can. Feel free to add or fix stuff!

**Can I reupload this Addon [any reason...]?**
- Unfortunately, no. Please share any improvement you may have made with us! So we can improve this addon together!
- Even if you just want to reupload the materials, every reupload is forbidden due to the steam workshop policy.
- This Addon aint that big, just add it to your collection, instead of reuploading it multiple times.
- If you want to use the github version, instead of the steam version, just add both to your server. Drag & Drop the GitHub Version right into your server addons folder, and then add the steam version to your collection. Thats it. GMod prefers the Server-File Version. However, you'll still need the steam version for the materials.

**Multiplayer Only?**
Yep, this addon will not work properly in Singleplayer.
